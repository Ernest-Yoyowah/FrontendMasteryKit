# Data Structures Notes

## Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.

- **Operations:**
  - Access: O(1)
  - Insertion (at end): O(1)
  - Insertion (at arbitrary position): O(n)
  - Deletion (at end): O(1)
  - Deletion (at arbitrary position): O(n)

## Linked Lists

Linked lists consist of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node.

- **Types:**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List

- **Operations:**
  - Access: O(n)
  - Insertion (at beginning): O(1)
  - Insertion (at end): O(n)
  - Deletion (at beginning): O(1)
  - Deletion (at end): O(n)

## Stacks

Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

- **Operations:**
  - Push: O(1)
  - Pop: O(1)
  - Peek: O(1)

## Queues

Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

- **Operations:**
  - Enqueue: O(1)
  - Dequeue: O(1)
  - Peek: O(1)
