# Front-End Development Coding Assessment Questions

## Programming Fundamentals:

1. Write a function in JavaScript to reverse a string without using built-in methods.
2. Implement a function to check if a given number is prime or not.
3. Create a program that generates Fibonacci series up to a given number. // Pending
4. Write a function to find the factorial of a number recursively.
5. Implement a binary search algorithm in JavaScript.
6. Create a function to sort an array of integers in ascending order using bubble sort.
7. Write a program to find the largest and smallest elements in an array.
8. Implement a stack data structure in JavaScript.

## Problem-Solving:

9. Given an array of integers, find the sum of all positive numbers.
10. Design an algorithm to detect if two strings are anagrams of each other.
11. Solve the classic "FizzBuzz" problem: print numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3 print "Fizz," for multiples of 5 print "Buzz," and for multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
12. Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.
13. Write a program to find the longest common prefix among an array of strings.
14. Given a sorted array of integers, write a function to remove duplicate elements in-place.
15. Design an algorithm to find the second largest element in an array.

## Communication and Collaboration:

16. Describe a challenging coding problem you encountered and how you solved it.
17. Explain a time when you had to work on a team project and how you contributed to its success.
18. Discuss a situation where you had to communicate technical concepts to a non-technical audience.
19. Describe your approach to resolving conflicts within a team environment.
20. How do you prioritize tasks and manage your time effectively when working on multiple projects simultaneously?

## Creativity and Innovation:

21. Propose a creative solution to improve website loading speed and performance.
22. Design a user interface for a mobile app that promotes productivity.
23. Discuss a new feature idea for a popular website or application and how you would implement it.
24. Describe a project where you utilized emerging technologies or techniques to achieve a unique solution.
25. How do you stay updated on the latest trends and developments in front-end development?

## CodeSignal-style Questions:

26. Given an array of numbers, implement a function `findMissingNumber` to find the missing number in the sequence.
    Example:
    Input: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
    Output: 3

27. Write a function `reverseWords` that reverses the order of words in a given sentence.
    Example:
    Input: "Hello world"
    Output: "world Hello"

28. Implement a function `validateEmail` that checks if a given string is a valid email address.
    Example:
    Input: "example@email.com"
    Output: true

29. Create a function `capitalizeWords` that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.
    Example:
    Input: "hello world"
    Output: "Hello World"

30. Design a function `findDuplicates` that returns an array of all duplicate elements in a given array.
    Example:
    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 3]
    Output: [2, 3]
